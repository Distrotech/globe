       globe - display the currently-lighted face of Earth in ASCII
                            version of 26mar94


A cute ASCII graphic hack.  The pictures were converted from 256x256
bitmaps using pbmtoascii.  The bitmaps originally came from Sun.  The
wrapper program took 20 minutes to write, including documentation.

Installation:
  - Edit Makefile and follow the instructions.
  - Make.
  - Make install.
That's all!
